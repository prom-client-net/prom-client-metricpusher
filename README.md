## Pushgateway

Sometimes when it is not possible to pull e.g. - nodes behind LB or there is a worker like daemon or windows service that does not have HTTP endpoint still there is way to push your metrics to Pushgateway server that you can install from [here](https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway/releases).

## Install

```sh
dotnet add package Prometheus.Client.MetricPusher
```

## Use

[Examples](https://github.com/prom-client-net/prom-examples)

One push. You can use Timer for regularly push to Pushgateway:

```c#
var pusher = new MetricPusher(new MetricPusherOptions
{
    Endpoint = "http://localhost:9091",
    Job = "pushgateway",
    Instance = "instance"
});

await pusher.PushAsync();
```

Push with Auth:

```c#
var pusher = new MetricPusher(new MetricPusherOptions
{
    Endpoint = "http://localhost:9091",
    Job = "pushgateway",
    Instance = "instance",
    AdditionalHeaders = new Dictionary<string, string> { { "Authorization", "Bearer " + accessToken } }
});
```

Background server:

```c#
var pusher = new MetricPusher(new MetricPusherOptions
{
    Endpoint = "http://localhost:9091",
    Job = "pushgateway"
});

var worker = new MetricPushServer(pusher);
worker.Start();
// code
worker.Stop();
```
